# AI Stock Market Predictor

A sophisticated stock market prediction application built with Next.js and Brain.js that uses neural networks to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

## 🚀 Features

- **Neural Network Predictions**: Uses Brain.js to train feedforward neural networks on historical stock data
- **Real-time Visualization**: Interactive charts powered by Chart.js showing historical vs predicted prices
- **Multiple Stock Support**: Analyze AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA with 60+ historical data points each
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI-generated confidence levels for predictions based on market volatility
- **Trend Analysis**: Clear bullish/bearish trend indicators with detailed explanations

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **AI/ML**: Brain.js for neural network implementation
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for interactive stock charts
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify ready

## 📊 Neural Network Architecture

- **Input Layer**: 5 neurons (price sequence)
- **Hidden Layer**: 8 neurons with sigmoid activation
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron (next price prediction)
- **Training**: Backpropagation with 2000 iterations
- **Data Processing**: Min-max normalization (0-1 range)

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd stock-predictor-app
   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Start the development server**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to \`http://localhost:3000\`

## 📈 How It Works

### Data Processing
1. Historical stock prices are normalized to 0-1 range for neural network training
2. Price sequences of 5 consecutive days are created as training inputs
3. Each sequence predicts the next day's closing price

### Model Training
1. The Brain.js neural network is configured with optimal hyperparameters
2. Training data consists of 80% of historical price sequences
3. Model trains for up to 2000 iterations or until error threshold is reached

### Prediction Generation
1. The trained model takes the last 5 days of prices as input
2. Output is denormalized back to actual price range
3. Confidence score is calculated based on recent price volatility
4. Trend direction (bullish/bearish) is determined by comparing predicted vs current price

## 🎯 Dataset Format

The application uses structured historical stock data:

\`\`\`typescript
{
  symbol: string,           // Stock ticker symbol
  name: string,            // Company name
  dates: string[],         // Array of date strings (YYYY-MM-DD)
  prices: number[]         // Array of closing prices
}
\`\`\`

Each stock dataset contains 60 historical data points spanning 3 months of trading data.

## 📚 Third-Party Libraries

- **brain.js**: Neural network library for JavaScript
- **chart.js**: Flexible charting library for data visualization
- **@radix-ui/react-***: Accessible UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **lucide-react**: Beautiful & consistent icon toolkit
- **next**: React framework for production applications

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

This application is created for **educational purposes only**. The predictions generated by the AI model should **not be used as financial advice**. Stock market investments carry inherent risks, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Always consult with qualified financial professionals before making investment decisions.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
