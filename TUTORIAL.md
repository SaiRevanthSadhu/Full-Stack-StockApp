July 2025

Abstract
This tutorial presents a comprehensive, project-based approach to developing a full-stack web application using the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The objective is to guide developers through each layer of the architecture, integrating best practices in authentication, session management, API routing, and UI design. The application developed throughout the tutorial encompasses real-world functionality including user registration, login via email/username, protected routes, session-aware navigation, and secure password handling with bcrypt. Additionally, the project structure adheres to modular and maintainable coding principles, enabling scalability and long-term sustainability. By the end of this tutorial, readers will have acquired the skills to independently design, implement, and deploy production-grade full-stack applications leveraging the power of JavaScript across the entire technology stack.
